***Hello world***, this is my first *Jekyll* blog post. This site is hosted on GitHub Pages and uses the [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) Jekyll theme. 

I do not intend this to be a personal blog, but instead post about topics in data science and data visualization. Obviously the choice of topics reflects personal preferences and leanings. 

The frequency of posts, as well as the lifetime of the blog itself, will be completely random and be based on available free 	time and my shifting interests.

For the most part, I will try and provide the full code and underlying data for any analysis (or links to them), as well as walkthroughs explaining my thought process. I have learned a lot from others, and want to make sure anyone can reproduce and improve on my results.

All posts are accessible from the [Posts](/archive/) link on the top bar.

I hope you like it! 

Find more info about me in the [About page](/about/).

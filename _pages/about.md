Hello there!

I am a postdoctoral researcher in Theoretical Particle Physics at the [University of California, Irvine](http://theory.physics.uci.edu/) since 2017. Previously I was a postdoc at [Rutgers University](http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/het/), and before that I did my Ph.D. in Physics at the [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu).

My recent research focuses on new ways to analyze the data generated at the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider). I have proposed new search strategies to identify new hypothetical particles that could be produced there, as well as data mining techniques to uncover them in large-dimensional datasets. I have previously worked on a variety of topics, including Dark Matter (what is it made of?), Baryogenesis (why is the Universe made of matter instead of nothing?), and model-building.


This website is a containter for projects in data science and related topics by yours truly.

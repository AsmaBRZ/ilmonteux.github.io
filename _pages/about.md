Hello there!

I am a deep learning practitioner, currently an AI fellow at [Insight Data Science](http://insightdata.ai/). I am excited to have the possibility of exploring the tools that will allow us to find new insights in the massive datasets of our day and age.

My background is in Particle Physics, where I spent my 20s learning and actively investigating data generated at the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider) to answer fundamental questions like the nature of dark matter, the origin of matter over anti-matter, or just investigating the frontier of our knowledge of the Universe.

During my wild ride to answer these questions, I moved from my home country of Italy to the United States, where I got my Ph.D. in Physics at the [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu) and then worked as postdoctoral researcher at the [University of California, Irvine](http://theory.physics.uci.edu/) and [Rutgers University](http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/het/). You can find all my academic publications on [INSPIRE](http://inspirehep.net/author/profile/A.Monteux.1).

This website is a containter for projects in data science and related topics by yours truly.

You can find a copy of my resume below, or download it directly [at this link](/assets/Monteux_cv_1page.pdf).
